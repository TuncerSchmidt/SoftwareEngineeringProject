#HOW TO BUILD


#It is really important to learn how to build. First when you clone our code on your desktop, you need to use a command called "git clone https://github.com/TuncerSchmidt/SoftwareEngineeringProject.git" then you will get a folder called "SoftwareEngineeringProject". First you need to say "cd SoftwareEngineeringProject" then enter. After that you will get folders such as yarn, npm , yolocode ... Again you need to say cd yolocode. In addition to that before running you need to do "npm install" and you also need to install yarn by command "npm install -g yarn". Then you need to be in yolocode folder. Then you need to type "yarn start" Server will be created directly. Then go to chrome and type localhost://3000. Website will be infront of your eyes

#DISCUSSION OF BUGS OR MISSING FEATURES



One of the biggest problem that I had was setting up the emailjs. I created my account on emailjs and I tested and submitted a test file. I also created template for email. However when I install it in my code. It did not give a response. All data is getting stored in firebase. I tried to do something more. Maybe I need to go and develop it later.
